# MC3DS-MAC
- **A 3DS (Nintendo 3DS) Homebrew Application that converts Material Attribute Files from MC-3DS Edition to  .json**

## Usage:
- **After downloading and installing the compiled .cia/.3dsx Open the application once to create a folder on the system SDHC Card.**
- **Then copy over your Material Attribute Files (.material, .material3ds, .images, .dat, .mat) in the newly created: "[mc3ds_files](https://github.com/Cracko298/MC3DS-MAC)" Folder.**
- **Enter the Application again, and now each file should have a newer generated file with the extension of ".json".**
